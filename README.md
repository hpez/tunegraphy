# Tunegraphy
Using [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org) and [Opencv (Cv2)](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python), this project aims to produce an accurate and relevant visual presentation (picture) of the given audio file.

In order to run the project do:
```
cd tunegraphy/src
python3 main.py
```
It will provide you with 4 pictures, which combined, form a full visual representation of the given audio file.
